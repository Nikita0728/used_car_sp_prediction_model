Overview
This repository aims to predict car prices using a dataset that contains information such as car make, model, mileage, engine size, and more. The dataset is preprocessed, followed by training of regression models to predict car prices. The models are evaluated on their accuracy and performance, with visualizations to assess their effectiveness.

Features
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing data.

Encode categorical variables.

Scale numerical features.

Machine Learning Models:

Linear Regression: A basic regression model to predict continuous variables.

Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble learning method for regression tasks, providing better accuracy.

Model Evaluation:

R² Score: A statistical measure indicating how well the model fits the data.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors between predicted and actual values.

Data Visualization:

Distribution of car prices and features.

Model performance visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas — For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy — For numerical operations.

matplotlib — For creating visualizations.

seaborn — For statistical data visualization.

scikit-learn — For machine learning models and metrics.

You can install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have the requirements.txt file, you can manually install the libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/prediction-model.git
cd prediction-model
Install the dependencies as mentioned above.

Usage
1. Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file (car.csv) containing various features related to cars. This dataset includes information such as price, make, model, and other car attributes. Ensure that this file is available in your project directory.

2. Running the Jupyter Notebook
The core of the analysis is contained in the Jupyter notebook prediction_model.ipynb. To execute the code:

Launch the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy
jupyter notebook prediction_model.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook, which includes:

Data loading.

Preprocessing steps.

Model training.

Evaluation and visualization.

3. Model Training
The machine learning models are trained using the following steps:

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical columns, and scale numerical features.

Model Training: Both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models are trained on the dataset.

Evaluation: The models are evaluated using R² score and Mean Squared Error.

4. Visualization
Various visualizations are generated, including:

Histograms to visualize the distribution of features and target variable (car price).
HeatMap of different features in the dataset vs selling price: Used correlation to find out how different factors affect selling price.

Model Evaluation
Linear Regression: A simple and interpretable model that provides a baseline.
Linear Regression:
RMSE= 307564.984846094
R2 Score: 0.5686872253789013
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble model that generally provides better performance than linear regression.
Random Forest:
RMSE: 129600.24125791158
R2 Score: 0.9234173907610739
Both models are evaluated using:

R² Score: Measures how well the model predicts the target variable.

Mean Squared Error: Measures the model's error between the predicted and actual values.
